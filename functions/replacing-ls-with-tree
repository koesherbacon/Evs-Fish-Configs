## Switching 'tree' for 'ls'
## Remember this will not work until 'sudo apt install tree (or similar) is installed ##
## Still need to figure out how to just have tree totally take over, but this is a great start...
#alias gindr="tree -f | grep"
alias tree="tree -Cphu --ignore-case"
alias ls1="tree -L 1"
alias gind="ls | grep"
alias gindr="tree -Cphu --ignore-case | grep "

alias ls2="tree -L 2"
alias ls3="tree -L 3"
alias ls4="tree -L 4"
alias ls5="tree -L 5"
alias lsn="tree -L " #then write in number of sub-dirs
