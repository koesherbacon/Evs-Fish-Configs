# My-Fish-Configs
Fish is the shell I use almost 100% of the time.  This is where I keep backups of my ~/.config/fish folder

The most important files are:
  - config.fish
    - which contains all my various aliases
  - functions/fish_prompt.fish
    - which contains my heavily customized prompt
    
There are also plenty of backup files for those two as well.  Back when I was testing various linux distros, I made several versions of config.fish based on which cli package manager they used.  Apt for Debian- and Ubuntu-based distros, Yaourt/Pacman for Arch-based distros, smart for certain RPM-based distros, and so on.  It took quite a while, but I finally settled on SolydXK, which is based on Debian Stretch (aka Debian 9 Stable).  Therefor, the most recent versions of config.fish and config.fish.bak have many aliases for apt/dpkg/gdebi commandes and commented out the other package managers.

Please feel free to use any of these creations yourself!  If you'd like an explaination of why I have chosen my prompt as well as my array of aliases, please feel free to ask :)
